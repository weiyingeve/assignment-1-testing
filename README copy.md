# 4NCT Fanpage
This project was created to make it easier for NCT (NCTzens) fans, new and old, to find all the details regarding the group and members easily. It also includes a photocard template, which makes it easier for NCTzens to find templates when new comebacks are released.

Some challenges I faced during this was finding a way to align the radios properly for the form, as well as trying to overlay texts on top of an image. 

Some features I might add in the future are solo project albums on the member page, songs the member has sung (for NCT U), and credits for songs the member has contributed to.
